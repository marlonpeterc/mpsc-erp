The ARTS Operational Data Model (ODM) is a retail-specific roadmap for database design that allows a company to plan how it organizes and uses its transaction data. 
The ARTS ODM offers retailers a comprehensive, mature basis for building integrated applications or selecting off-the-shelf retail solutions, and for helping application developers and analysts understand retail business principles and terminology.

A data warehouse is a database used for reporting and analysis. It stores current and historical data and is used for creating trending reports for senior management reporting, such as annual and quarterly comparisons. The ARTS data warehouse is a reference model, derived from the ARTS Operational Data Model, that retailers and their vendors can use to create their own data warehouses.
