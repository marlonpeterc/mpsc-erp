# Digital Efforts Continue To Be Strong

Retailers are as optimistic about their dot-com businesses as they are about their store businesses.
The good news is that retailers have been delivering success in their eCommerce divisions. In fact,
retailers reported that their key eCommerce metrics like conversion rates, average order values, and
retention rates were all improving (see Figure 8). To further support their eCommerce businesses,
retailers this year are focusing on key areas within:
* **Mobile**. Retailers continue to see a significant percentage of traffic to their sites coming from
mobile devices, but low mobile conversion rates still plague them (see Figure 9). To this end, they
are investing in ensuring that sites render well on all phones, both for customer experiences and
to ensure that they show up in Google search results, which prioritize mobile-optimized content.
What are retailers spending less time and money on? Apps and tablets. Despite substantial efforts
over the years to deliver great app experiences, retailers report only getting an average of 4% of
their online sales from apps. Additionally, the majority of retailers (64%) say they plan to keep tablet
investments flat or bring them down in 2018 (see Figure 10). On the other hand, 80% of surveyed
respondents will increase investments in smartphones, and mobile is the top digital priority in 2018.

* **Platform overhauls**. Whether it is due to omnichannel investments, security concerns, or
competitive drivers, more retailers say their key back-end priority in 2018 will be overhauling their
eCommerce platform or hosting. Thirty-three percent of retailers surveyed said they planned to
focus on this area of investment (see Figure 11).

* **Marketing**. Retailers frequently cited marketing tactics such as email, search, and social network
marketing as key areas of investment in 2018 (see Figure 12). Customer acquisition and retention
continues to be a challenge for retailers, and it is an easier lever to adjust because it generally
requires little IT or operations involvement.

* **The onsite experience**. Retailers still recognize that how shoppers experience a site affects
conversion. Site merchandising improvements therefore continue to be a key area of investment
and focus for retailers. What are some specific approaches to improving the shopper experience
online? Personalization is at the top of this list, and in 2018 it will involve clienteling and rendering
offers and imagery that change to address different shoppers or factors such as weather or
geography.

### Retailers Need To Focus On Digital Investments More Than Ever
Retail had a strong Q4 in 2017, but retailers cannot afford to be complacent. Digital investments all
but guarantee the ability to more cost-effectively deliver great customer experiences. As store-based
retailers continue to be challenged by low-margin online pure plays, companies without strong digital
strategies will fall behind. Specific takeaways from this year’s research include the following:
* **Apps are optional, but a strong desktop experience is not.** Mobile phones are ubiquitous within
our lives, but mobile commerce hasn’t yet dominated all of eCommerce, much less all of retail. This
fact is even more pronounced for apps: With few exceptions, most shoppers simply don’t use them.
Because desktop devices still dominate eCommerce transactions, retailers should not be distracted
by mobile and instead must focus at least as much on traditional desktops as they do on phones.
* **Price and/or selection are critical opportunities for differentiation**. We know that price and
selection are two of the biggest reasons that consumers shop online — yet lower prices and
broad selections weren’t big areas of investment for retailers this year. Retailers need to position
themselves to take a greater share of shoppers’ wallets by making commoditized products pricecompetitive
and by expanding the selection within their biggest categories.
* **The associate automation gap needs to be closed**. Retailers know the importance of automating
tasks in stores, but few have actually put those solutions in place. This year, they need to focus
on elements like task automation and even simply first providing web content to store associates.
Then, as they evolve, retailers should enable features like self-scheduling on mobile devices.
* **Not all retail executives have bought into digital transformation**. By now, digital transformation
is well understood, yet even today retail organizations don’t always accept it. Celebrate digital
successes within your organization, continue to educate top management regularly about
consumer expectations, and spread the word throughout the organization about the benefits and
wins that come with embracing digital solutions.
* **Bright, shiny objects still entrance — and distract — retailers**. Ensure first and foremost that
you implement and effectively execute tried-and-true solutions like endless aisle and in-store
pickup. Focus first on eliminating customer pain points and making the store associate more
effective, and do not chase whatever is hot.
